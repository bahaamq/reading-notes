version controls is a way to track updates on your files and have all  the previous versions  (to have the ability to "UNDO".)
it can be locally , centralized and distrbuted
locally : on your machine. (may face a problem if your hard drive fails down)
centralized : one server serve a team (may face a problem if the server fails down)
distrbuted: many servers that do mirriroring repositries from the main repositry  so if a problem occurs with the main server there will be the same repositry on other server.

Git: 
-is considered to distrbuted Version controls.
- it makes a copy of ane new changes when save (commit)

Git is looking at your history (track) on the local disk.
