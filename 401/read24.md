**Hashtable** is a key value pair data structure that return the index of the key  hash tables used for holding unique things in one index ,  example assuming you have an English dictionary that has key value pairs from a to z assuming you want to search for a word that starts with"x" . It will slow if we want to look through the array in the worst case it's going to be *O(n)* to find that word however the time complexity in hashing is *o(1)* there is something called chaining  which holds multi data in one index so assume the dictionary ~~example~~ and you want to search from key "x" this key will be linked with *linkedlist* for example that has many English words that starts with "x" .
