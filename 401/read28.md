*Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.  
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.*  
*Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.Undirected graph : each node in the graph can access to another node (bidirectional)Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.Complete Graphs*  
*A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.Connected*  
*A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.Disconnected*  
*A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.Acyclic Graph*  
*An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.Cyclic Graphs*  
*A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex. since the graph could have cycle when traversing it using bfs you should handle the cycle in order not to have an infinite loopDFS in graph we use stacks*
