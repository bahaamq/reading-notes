## Review, Research, and Discussion
*Container*: is a technology that's used to solve the problem when the enviroment with two machines that should run the application are different , or when the application is developed in an enviroment and should run in different enviroments (OS) , pastly to do something like that we were using virtual machine when there is one real os on our machine and virtualize another Os just for runnung this app , but what container the process is better as it has a container that doesn't relate to the operating system and use only the kernal of the needed OS so no need o install fully OS

Ÿê*AutoScaling:is* a way to automatically scale up or down the number of compute resources that are being allocated to your application based on its needs at any given time.

*bandwidth:the* amont of data that can be send from one point to another

*Cloud Services:* Taking advantage of *remote cloud computing server** rather than an on-site server

_Cloud architecture_  is how individual technologies are integrated to create clouds

*AWS* :  a service that provide cloud servers


## Preview
*Amazon S3* has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

*Lambda:*
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

*Lambda Function:*
you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically

*CDN:*
is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together,
