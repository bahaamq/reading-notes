## Review, Research, and Discussion

*Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle*
Cycle between the client and the server , the client (ex:web browser,ApI) , the client send a request the server process then response.

*Server*: is PC (whatever if its locally or on the cloud) that has things the client doesn't have so when the client asks for it , it responds with it. or if the client , when the client want to add things to the server in order to ask for them later example the server take them and savethem into for ex database  /file system 
same with update,delete,, **Crud operations** starting from when the client send a req , untill the server take it and make action based on the request.

What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Rather than it's being locally now its on the internet and everyone unless "there is specific restrictions for specific people" has access to it .

Publisher/Subscriber: rather than req-response life cycle publisher is something could be a (server)  between the req,res  that take all requests and reponsense then publish it asynchronously to subscribers(clients) one of it's benifits is Independently

## Preview

*Virtual machine,Virtualization :* running a virtual  on your real os using the help of virtual machine printable , putting many virtual machines in  one physical machine 

*EC2*:is a cloud servce from amazon , what it does is rather than buying a server to deploy your website , it provides a way to give you as much as you want virtual servers as you want , on of the benefits is load balancing and less cost as servers are expensive and need special environments and care.

*AWS Elastic Beanstalk* : rather than taking care of system administration when deploying a web app  Elastic Beanstalk is a service for that takes care of deployment stuffs
