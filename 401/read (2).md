**Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST**
When a request for data is sent to a REST API, it's usually done through hypertext transfer protocol (commonly referred to as HTTP). Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST (called RESTful APIs or RESTful web services) can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON. JSON (JavaScript object notation) is favored as a message format because it can be read by any programming language (despite the name), is human- and machine-readable, and is lightweight. In this way, RESTful APIs are more flexible and can be easier to set up.
