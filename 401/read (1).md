**Map** to iterate over all elements and return whatever value you want for each element , ex for each element in array return it but add 2 for it  
**Reduce** can be used to retrieve one element for example the summation for all array elements
.**Promise** is an object that is used to manage *asynchronous* function so when the asynchronous function is running the promise is resolved it will go to and proceed .then method or will complete after await the value know that the promise is resolved otherwise will go to catch which means it's rejected~ **Callbacks** are not asynchronous unless if it executes after the main*parent* function returns a value or done so the child depend on it and wait for it to retrive a val example if you pass a function to another as an argument(callback) however it will call this argument(function) after running the main (parent) function  ....
 *An example of synchronous is map method which the callbacks function first return values for each iteration then the main function returns value*

*TDD is a software development approach that used to check all function are working properly and passes the test cases expected results *
it's one way to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code*
