Node js is a **javascript Run time**

*uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine (responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code) and libuv library*
*event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O (input/output)*

*here are over 1,000,000 packages under NPM AND NODE IS bundled withIT*
*use -g if you wish to install a package from npm globally. and -y for locally

you allow any developer to clone your project and use it , by providing packages name in package.json file , after clonning it they only have to run **npm install** command. as there is no need to upload node-Modules on the vcs 

Npm is useful as it has multi modules that can be useful for automate some processes which make things faster

Node JS is a single-threaded.  **event-driven** , if the request was blocking any other processes it goes into the process then back to the main request 

Node JS speaks JSON. JSON
