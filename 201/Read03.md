in HTML , there are threee types of lists , unordered , ordered , defination 
Lists can be nested.

there are many ways to give value for width and height the most accurate is using "PX",
percentage is used based on the width of the container.
em is used based on text font size (width = ex:2em-> width will be *2 of font-size )

min-max-width-height: are used to show better results when using differnt-devices , however they may cause overflow issue but it can be resolved by many ways ex: scroll

every element has a border you can choose the space betwen the element it self and the border by using padding but between the element and the container(parent) this is done by using margin.

the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none is , visibility convert the element to empty white space however display:none remove it at all (no place)

code is a series of instructions

Switch is a conditional statetement to check based on case, the default value is when no cases match the expectations.
