
-Conditional operators , used to check and compare between values, and returns true or false,
there are two types of conditional operators: 
compare based on value only (==),(!=)
compare based on value and data-type (===,!===)
ex (3=='3') is true. however(3==='3') is equal to false.

-logical operators are used to compare multi conditions , and each comparision returns a value then compare the all valus to know the final results.

Loops are used to repeat (a part of code)more than once, 
there are three types of loops, 
'For loop', 'While' ,'Do-While' .

They are all do the same (execute a part of code based on condition)., but Do while executes  1 time before check the condition.
