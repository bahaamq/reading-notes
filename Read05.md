
-Conditional operators , used to check and compare between values, and returns true or false,
there are two types of conditional operators: 
compare based on value only (==),(!=)
compare based on value and data-type (===,!===)
ex (3=='3') is true. however(3==='3') is equal to false.

Loops are used to repeat (a part of code)more than once, 
there are three types of loops, 
'For loop', 'While' ,'Do-While' .

They are all do the same (execute a part of code based on condition)., but Do while executes  1 time before check the condition.
